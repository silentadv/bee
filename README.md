var_decl_stmt  ::= "let" identifier type_anotation? "=" expr ";"
exit_stmt      ::= "exit" expr ";"

```ts
let x = 10;
let y = x;
exit y;
```

## TODO

- [ ] Implement constant variable declaration parsing;
- [ ] Implement support to more literal types;
- [x] Implement code generation for expression and var declaration statements;
- [x] Implement type checker and symbol table;
- [ ] Create a logger for better error handling;
